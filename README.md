# Artificial-Fishbowl
Artificial Fishbowl

It was simulated an environment using the following artificial life methods:

Lindenmayer systems to simulate vegetation.
Affine Transformations using Moving Least Squares for mesh deformation.
Turing Morph for fish textures (Activator-Inhibitor Systems)
BOIDS to simulate the flocking behavior of animals and to avoid collisions.
A segregation model based on a happiness function that must be satisfied for group formation.
A Prey-Predator model modifying the steer of a fish, according to the size of the fishes in other groups. Hence, the fish will chase or avoid them.
